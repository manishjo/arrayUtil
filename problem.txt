----------- 1.0 ----------
Implement a ArrayUtil DataType and methods around it.
The ArrayUtil contains an array, element size and how many elements are there.

ArrayUtil create(int elementSize, int elements) 
will create an array and wrap it with the ArrayUtil and return it.

ArrayUtil resize(ArrayUtil util, int elements) 
will resize the array and return the modified ArrayUtil. 
The array contents should be trimmed if new size is less and copied over if the new size is more.

To use the array you just have to cast it to pointer of the respective type: like int* a, float* a ,etc and then a[5] will give you the fifth int or float

-------------- 1.1 ---------------
Implement a findIndex method.

int findIndex(ArrayUtil util, void* element)
will return -1 if not found and the array index of the element if found

for example to search 5 in [4,2,1,5,6,0]
int x = 5;
findIndex(util, &x) will return 3 

--------------1.2----------------

Implement a method dispose to free the memory allocated for the Array inside array util

void dispose(ArrayUtil util)

-------------- 1.3 ----------------

Implement a findFirst method to find the first element matching the criteria.

void* findFirst(ArrayUtil util, MatchFunc* match, void* hint);
which returns the first element which matches the criteria or null if there is no match.

where the signature of the MatchFunc is:

int MatchFunc(void* hint, void* item);
which will return 0 in case of no match and 1 in case of match.
As C language does not have closure, we have some hint that can be passed, which will help in customizing the match.

for example: 
int isEven(void* hint, void* item)
can be used to find if a given number is even. Here the hint is not needed.

int isDivisible(void* hint, void* item)
can be used to find if a given number is divisible by the number mentioned in the hint.

------------- 1.4 ------------

Implement a findLast method similar to findFirst

---------------- 1.5 ---------------------

Implement a count method to count the number of elements matching the criteria.

int count(ArrayUtil util, MatchFunc* match, void* hint);

------------------- 1.6 ------------------------

Implement a filter method to find the first n elements matching the criteria.

int filter(ArrayUtil util, MatchFunc* match, void* hint, void** destination, int maxItems );
where destination is an array of pointers into which the address of the matching elements are copied onto. maxitems is the capacity of destination.
 
The method returns the number of elements which matches the criteria that have been copied onto the destination.
